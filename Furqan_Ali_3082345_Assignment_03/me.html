			<h2>About the Author</h2>

			<p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website</p>
			<img src="images/me.jpeg" class="me-pic">
			<p>This is Furqan, I was born in Lahore-Pakistan but grew up in Dubai-UAE. I am 20 years old and I have been living in Dubai for the past 15 years. I recentenly completeded my A-levels and now I would love to do Bachelors in Computer Science. I intend to complete my Bachelors at Griffith College and pursue a Masters in Cyber Security. My goal is to make networks as efficient as possible and to learn all about their intricacies.</p>

			<p>I always liked to design websites and understand how they work. I have developed websites before but not something as big as this. This was my very first hands-on full website attempt with CSS and I found it very interesting. CSS helped me add many features to my websites that I was previously unaware of. Here at Griffith College java is taught mainly and it is very fun trying to learn in. For me programming is like solving a puzzle and I enjoy every bit of it.</p>

			<p>I hope this website on Muhammad Ali was interesting and made you learn something about him.</p>
